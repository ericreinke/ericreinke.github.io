<!-- How was my starting rating determined? 
If your first RO appearance was the community voted rankings for 2020 (top 31 players), you were assigned a rating according to a simple 0.5x^2 curve with y=1485 at x=0 and y=1250 at x=30
If your first RO appearance was an advanced or elite division, you were automatically assigned a rating of 1000*
If your first RO appearance was in any other division other than the highest open division, you were automatically assigned a rating of 800
All players in the womens ranking list were automatically assigned a starting rating of 1000
.
*There are special cases where we attempted to accurately rate new players to ensure more accurate results.  One example is Thomas Hamilton, one of the best players in the world at the time, who played in ROTC Windsor 2023.  Giving him a standard starting rating of 1000 would incorrectly impact the rankings and would take dozens of games (if not, tournaments) amongst the community to resolve.


I have signed up on Fwango with different names and different email addresses/accounts.  Are all my games correctly counted?
If you do not see your name multiple times on the full rankings, then we have already manually managed your multiple accounts.  If you see your name more than once please let us know and we can correct this.

I see a game that is incorrect.  Can I resolve this?
With the way Fwango teams works, it is very possible that games are listed with incorrect players, or simply the score was inputted incorrectly at the time.  We tried our best to audit all tournaments, especially those in 2023, however older tournaments are harder to remember.  If you see an incorrect entry please let us know and we can correct it or mark it as 'excluded' from our ranking calculations.  Since all rankings would be re-calculated it is very likely that older games (<=2022) will have minimal effect on your current ranking.

Do games in Women's divisions affect rating in the open ranking?
No; only games in the women's division can affect the women's rankings and all other divisions besides coed affect the open rankings

Why is there no co-ed ranking?
There are simply not enough co-ed events to make any meaningful or accurate ranking.  


Does this mean someone who has competed in a women's division and an open division can appear on both rankings?
Yes -->
