            <div class="indent">
            <span>The Reinke Roundnet Rating system is, at its core, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ELO rating system</a>.  It takes the average rating of both players on both teams for each game, and based on the winner, some rating is exchanged.  Both players on a given team will win or lose the same rating after any game, regardless of their relative rating to eachother.  The rating exchanged is always zero sum (with the exception of Rating Rerun). </span>

            <div><span class="bold title">Does score matter?</span></div>
            <div class="indent">
            <span>Not as of now, but perhaps in the future.  When this happens, it will be in a way that would only ever benefit the winning team, as to incentivize inserting correct scores in fwango instead of 1-0.</span>

            <div><span class="bold title">How are games in a best of 3 calculated?</span></div>
            <div class="indent">
            <span>Games in a best of 3 are all calculated individually and chronologically.  The winners of game 1 will win rating from the losers, and same with game 2 and potentially game 3.  This means that you would lose less rating if you were to lose a set 2-1, since in the one game that you did win, you won some rating back.  This can make a big difference in cases where a relatively weak team takes a game off of a relatively strong team.  For example if the strong team loses game 2 against the weaker team but wins game 3, their rating change might look something like this:<br/><br/>Game 1 (W): +1<br/>Game 2 (L): -49<br/>Game 3 (W): +1<br/>Net: -47<br/><br/>This is an extreme case but you here you can see that the winning team of a set can actually lose a fair amount of rating.</span>

            <div class="indent">
            <span>All first round loss games in a single elimination bracket are worth half of those in pools and the regular bracket with the exception of the 3rd place game.  This means you win and lose half of what you usually would, had you played this match up in pools or main bracket.</span>

            <div class="indent">
            <span>No.  Games that are forfeit before their start do not count for any rating change and are indicated in fwango by a negative score for the forfeiting team.<br/><br/>Games that are forfeit in the middle of play for any reason do count for rating change and the score should be recorded in fwango as it was at the time of the forfeit</span>

            <div class="indent">
            <span>Your initial rating is determined based on the first Ontario tournament you played.  If you signed up for the highest possible open division, your starting rating is set to 1000.  If you did not, your starting rating is 500.  The same applies to the women's rankings however it has been rare to see more than one women's division in Ontario<br/> There are a few exceptions.  The following players had their starting rating evaluated manually:<br/><br/></span>

            <span>In short; no.  As all ELO systems do, players that are far from their deserved rating are quickly moved towards it.  If you start at a much lower rating than you should be, your wins will give you much more rating and your losses will lose you much less.<br/><br/>Consider the following example:  The left chart is the top 10 active players as of May 1 2024.  The right chart is the same list but we have changed Chris Brown's starting rating to be 500 instead of 1000<br/><br/></span>

              <span><br/>After recalculating all games, we see that Chris' rating is now roughly 40 rating less; a relatively small amount given the 500 rating adjustment we made.  Chris remains still very clearly the second best player at this time.  We also see the next biggest impact is that of Ben's rating (+25).  This is explained by the fact that Ben is commonly Chris' partner.<br/><br/>**Every other player in the entire list at this time, not just the top 10, experiences AT MOST a single digit rating change because of our modification (a near negligible difference in the long run).</span>

            <span>You do not appear on the rankings for one of two reasons:<br/><br/>1. You are marked as 'inactive'.  The requirements for being active are as follows: <br/><br/>Open:<br/> - You must have played at least 2 tournaments within the last 9 months<br/> - You must have played at least 1 official ROTC tournament within the last 9 months<br/><br/>Womens:<br/> - You must have played at least 1 tournament in a women's only division in the last 9 months <br/> <br/>2. You are marked as a foreign player:  This is an Ontario only ranking list and only includes players from Ontario.  Foreign players still have a rating and are processed like any other player, they just do not appear on the rankings.</span>

            <span>In theory every tournament played in Ontario should be included, as more data would lead to a more accurate rating list.  However, in practice, there a few reasons why a given tournament might be excluded:<br/><br/>- The tournament does not follow the IRF ruleset at the time (eg. Revol, basement tournament, etc...)<br/>- The tournament owner does not want to share the fwango<br/>- The complete fwango does not exist (eg. Individual tournaments, tournaments pre 2021, etc...)<br/>- The tournament was very clearly advertised as one that does not promote competition<br/>- The tournament has many foreign or new players that are not expected to play another Ontario tournament in the near future, making the initial ratings hard to estimate and render the results from majority of games useless (eg. Toronto STS)</span>

<!-- 


I have signed up on Fwango with different names and different email addresses/accounts.  Are all my games correctly counted?
If you do not see your name multiple times on the full rankings, then we have already manually managed your multiple accounts.  If you see your name more than once please let us know and we can correct this.

I see a game that is incorrect.  Can I resolve this?
With the way Fwango teams works, it is very possible that games are listed with incorrect players, or simply the score was inputted incorrectly at the time.  We tried our best to audit all tournaments, especially those in 2023, however older tournaments are harder to remember.  If you see an incorrect entry please let us know and we can correct it or mark it as 'excluded' from our ranking calculations.  Since all rankings would be re-calculated it is very likely that older games (<=2022) will have minimal effect on your current ranking.

Do games in Women's divisions affect rating in the open ranking?
No; only games in the women's division can affect the women's rankings and all other divisions besides coed affect the open rankings

Why is there no co-ed ranking?
There are simply not enough co-ed events to make any meaningful or accurate ranking.  


Does this mean someone who has competed in a women's division and an open division can appear on both rankings?
Yes -->
